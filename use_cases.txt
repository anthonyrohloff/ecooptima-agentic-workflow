Framework
The framework is built on the foundation and integrates artificial intelligence with marginal
abatement cost curves (MACCs) to address sustainability economics:
• Community-urban afforestation optimization – Design natural plant bundles (like
“Legos”) for urban afforestation using digital technology, AI agents, and custom
GPTs, guided by MACCs, to maximize carbon absorption and enable scalable
implementation.
• Consumer-focused sustainability economics – Create a MACC for climate change
mitigation that evaluates options from green purchases to EV adoption and solar
installations.
• Business-focused sustainability economics – Create a MACC for climate change
mitigation for businesses, covering strategies from energy-efficient buildings to EVs,
carbon capture and storage (CCS), and direct air capture (DAC).
• Government-focused – Create a MACC for incentive-based tax policy based on
carbon removal credits aimed at accelerating the adoption and establishment of
new systems throughout the community, fostering broader engagement and
investment.
• Academic-focused – Create a MACC for climate change mitigation for academic
institutions that considers sustainability research, knowledge transfer, and job
opportunities.
